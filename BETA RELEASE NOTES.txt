-------RELEASE NOTES for WISP-T BETA 1.1-------

Basic functionality:
The program should start up with an automatically generated empty tree & profile, and editor mode on. The editor mode pane on the left includes 5 buttons that alter whatever branch or leaf (hereafter referred to collectively as "Node") is currently selected. 
The plus adds a node as a child to the currently selected node. 
The minus deletes the node, and all children/content. 
The pencil alters the currently selected node. 
The up arrow moves the currently selected node up one, so that it appears one node higher than its siblings. 
The down arrow does the same, but makes it appear one node lower than its siblings.

Note that in order to change the title and content of the node, to add screenshots, or to add tips, a separate window is opened, and the text is entered into that window. This will change in Beta 1.2 - it will all be done directly from within WISP-T while editor mode is active, no separate window.
Note also that in order for the changes you have made to a node to appear, you must completely de-select, then re-select that node. This will also be patched in Beta 1.2 .
Editor mode may be turned on/off from Settings, under insertUsernameHere Preferences. 

Settings also allows you to define node behavior while in "Training Mode". It lists the User password, the Admin Password, the Locked Message, and the number of times a user can "Unlock" a node with their user password.
When enabled, Training Mode will replace the main text of a node with the Locked Message after that node has been accessed more than the administrator wants. Right now there's not much distinction between a regular user and an administrator, and the administrator has no control over how many times a node may be accessed before it gets locked. This will be patched in future releases.

User profile functionality is incomplete. Right now WISP-T tries to load a "default" profile, and if one does not exist in the user profiles folder, it will create one. In the future, the default profile will be a static object that either: 
A. exists, or 
B. is created if it does not exist. 
There will be no external files for default profiles.
When user profile functionality is complete, WISP-T will save user profiles(and related content such as screenshots and tree files) on a server, so that they are accessible from any computer. Admin profiles will have power over certain properties of non-admin profiles. The state of WISP-T will be saved to the currently loaded profile when WISP-T: 
A. exits, and 
B. changes profiles, including which tree was opened, which node was selected, whether the tree and/or tips panes are expanded/collapsed, and anything else I find to be relevant.

Note that the cancel button in settings does nothing right now. You have to click the X in the corner to close without saving changes.
Still investigating miscellaneus bugs and necessary interface optimizations.
