:fixed: Node should not always be on top, it's annoying.
:fixed: Node needs to be larger, at least 200x400
:sorta fixed:Node could use a tiny button (10x10?) in the corner somewhere that calls pack();, might have to make a GridLayout(2,2) with two empty frames at 1,2 and 2,1.
When creating a new node, text should not be what the parent text is, should have default text(except maybe the title to remind you which parent it's coming from)
Edit node should include an option for setting the order of children/siblings.
:fixed: New/Edit don't need JOptionPanes to pop up - they can just go directly to Node.
Need to change the toString() method in Stringable to only display the title, OR explicitly invoke the getTitle() method somehow when displaying the title in nodes.
Node cancel button still does nothing, exit button does not prevent any changes made.

:fixed: WISP-T: need to link a select/single click on a node with the center text field changing to a call on that node's object's getContent() method.

action taken on checkboxes needs to...pack()? the corresponding jtextarea? Or maybe it needs to be nested in a jScrollPane...that might be better...
